# Before run the script, we have to put the not running service in a variable to see what’s services you need to start:
                         $stoppedServices = Get-Service | Where-Object {$_. Status -ne "Running"}
# Then retrieve the value of this variable to see not running services on your machine 
                         $stoppedService 
# Copy the serviceName you want to start, then run the script and pass its name like the following:
ScriptName.ps1 ServiceName 
# 	we can’t make the script to run any service not running automatically because there is some service can’t be starte manually overall, so the script will always give an error in this case, so this is the best way to run a specific service if its nor running and cased a problem in the server main function, the script also wil validate the service you entered, if it doesn’t exist, it will till you also.
